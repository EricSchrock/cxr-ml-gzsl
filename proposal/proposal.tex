\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Proposed Project}

For my project, I propose to reproduce some or all of the findings of the paper, "Multi-Label Generalized Zero Shot Learning for the Classification of Disease in Chest Radiographs" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}. Compute power will likely determine whether I am able to reproduce the full set of findings or merely a subset, given the time remaining in the semester (more about this in Section~\ref{sec:computation-feasibility}). In addition to reproducing original findings, I propose to implement and test at least one ablation or extension of the work done by the authors of the paper (see Section~\ref{sec:ablations-and-extensions}).

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Deep learning models for classifying diseases from chest X-ray (CXR) images have had great success, achieving comparable results to human experts. However, collecting and labeling training data for these models is expensive and time-consuming. For rarer diseases, it is often not economical, and sometimes not even possible, to gather the amount of data needed for supervised learning models. When a new disease emerges, the need for massive data collection slows the response. Human radiologists leverage other sources of knowledge to identify diseases they have previously never seen in X-ray form. Could a deep learning model do the same?

Multi-label generalized zero shot learning (ML-GZSL), which uses semantic information to identify classes not present in the set of labeled images used to train the model, has worked well in similar circumstances \cite{10.1109/TPAMI.2012.256, 10.1109/TMM.2019.2924511, 9157745}. However, these prior works have at least two limitations. First, they "extract a fixed visual representation of the image from a pre-trained visual encoder or a detection network" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}, which means they cannot be trained end-to-end. Second, "projecting these extracted visual features to the semantic space shrinks the diversity of the visual information, which gives rise to inherent limitations" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}, one of those being the hubness problem \cite{dinu2015improvingzeroshotlearningmitigating}. Can these limitations be overcome?

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Specific Approach}

The paper in question proposes the CXR-ML-GZSL model, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model}. It is comprised of a pre-trained text encoder to convert class labels to a semantic embedding space, a trainable visual encoder to convert X-ray images to a visual embedding space, and mapping models into a shared latent embedding space. The output is a score for each possible class, representing how relevant it is to the input image.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

Since the visual encoder is trainable, the whole pipeline between the X-ray image and the semantic embedding of the class label is trainable from end-to-end, better tuning the overall model to the task at hand. Additionally, the added latent embedding space is meant to address the limitations of mapping the visual embedding space directly onto the semantic embedding space.

The increased complexity of this model, compared to other ML-GZSL models, requires a multifaceted training objective, captured in a three-part loss function, where $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are the regularization parameters for the second and third components of the loss function.

\begin{equation}
    \min_{\boldsymbol{\phi} ,\boldsymbol{\rho} ,\boldsymbol{\psi}} \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{{rank}} +\gamma_{1} \mathcal{L}_{align} +\gamma_{2} \mathcal{L}_{con},
    \label{eqn:full_loss}
\end{equation}

\texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{L}_{rank}$}: adds penalties for any positive ground-truth relevance scores not larger than all negative grouth-truth relevance scores by at least a margin of $\delta$. \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{L}_{align}$}: adds penalties if input images and their labels do not map near each other in the latent embedding space. \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{L}_{con}$}: add penalties if labels do not have similar relationships in both the semantic and latent embedding spaces, as those semantic relationships are key to zero shot learning. 

For the pre-trained text encoder, the model uses BioBERT \cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682}, which was trained specifically on a biomedical corpora. For the trainable visual encoder, the model uses Densenet-121 \cite{rajpurkar2017chexnetradiologistlevelpneumoniadetection}, as at that time it was the best chest X-ray classifier. For both BioBERT and Densenet-121, the model skips the final classification step in order to get semantic and visual embeddings, respectively, as output instead. The two mapping models are both three layer feed-forward neural networks.

The model was trained over 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer \cite{kingma2017adammethodstochasticoptimization}, with multiple repetitions to tune the learning rate, $\gamma_1$, and $\gamma_2$ hyperparameters. It's performance was measured using the "overall precision, recall and f1 scores for the top $k$ predictions where $k \in \{2, 3 \}$ [as well as] the average area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for seen and unseen classes and its harmonic mean, since computing recall for top k predictions may not be a sufficient indicator of class-wise performance" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}.

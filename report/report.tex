This report details the results of my final project for CS 598: Deep Learning for Healthcare. My final project had three components.

First, I attempted to reproduce a portion of the findings of the paper "Multi-Label Generalized Zero Shot Learning for the Classification of Disease in Chest Radiographs" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}, specifically the AUROC scores of the proposed model on each of the fourteen diseases labeled in the the dataset. I tried three approaches. The first used the code and pre-trained weights provided by the paper, the second used the provided code but not the provided weights, and the third used neither. Only the first attempt successfully reproduced the AUROC scores reported in the original paper.

Second, I replaced the visual encoder used by the proposed model, DenseNet-121 \cite{huang2018denselyconnectedconvolutionalnetworks}, with the lighter weight EfficientNet-B0 \cite{tan2020efficientnetrethinkingmodelscaling} to see if I could achieve faster training times with comparable AUROC scores. Training was significantly faster, but the AUROC scores were significantly worse.

Third, I submitted a pull request (PR) to PyHealth \cite{pyhealth2023yang}, an open source project dedicated to supporting healthcare-related AI research and applications. My PR added support for the ChestX-ray14 \cite{Wang_2017} dataset and for binary classification tasks on the fourteen diseases labeled in the dataset.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Summary of the Paper in Question}

Deep learning models for classifying diseases from chest X-ray (CXR) images have had great success, achieving comparable results to human experts. However, collecting and labeling training data for these models is expensive and time-consuming. For rarer diseases, it is often not economical, and sometimes not even possible, to gather the amount of data needed for supervised learning models. When a new disease emerges, the need for massive data collection slows the response. Human radiologists leverage other sources of knowledge to identify diseases they have previously never seen in X-ray form. Could a deep learning model do the same?

Multi-label generalized zero shot learning (ML-GZSL), which uses semantic information to identify classes not present in the set of labeled images used to train the model, has worked well in similar circumstances \cite{10.1109/TPAMI.2012.256, 10.1109/TMM.2019.2924511, 9157745}. However, these prior works have at least two limitations. First, they "extract a fixed visual representation of the image from a pre-trained visual encoder or a detection network" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}, which means they cannot be trained end-to-end. Second, "projecting these extracted visual features to the semantic space shrinks the diversity of the visual information, which gives rise to inherent limitations" \cite{hayat2021multilabel}, one of those being the hubness problem \cite{dinu2015improvingzeroshotlearningmitigating}. Can these limitations be overcome?

"Multi-Label Generalized Zero Shot Learning for the Classification of Disease in Chest Radiographs" \cite{hayat2021multilabel} proposes the CXR-ML-GZSL model (Figure~\ref{fig:model}). It is comprised of a pre-trained text encoder to convert class labels to a semantic embedding space, a trainable visual encoder to convert X-ray images to a visual embedding space, and mapping models into a shared latent embedding space. The output is a score for each possible class, representing how relevant it is to the input image.

\end{figure}

CXR-ML-GZSL is the first use of ML-GZSL to classify diseases from chest X-ray images. It is also unique from other ML-GZSL models in the following three ways.

\begin{itemize}
    \item It can be trained end-to-end, thanks to the trainable visual encoder.
    \item It maps both the semantic and visual embedding spaces into a shared latent embedding space, instead of mapping the visual space onto the semantic space, losing less visual information.
    \item It uses BioBERT, which was trained on a biomedical corpora, resulting semantic embeddings that are tuned for healthcare use cases.
\end{itemize}

The result is better performance when classifying both seen and unseen diseases in chest X-ray images, compared to two state-of-the-art ML-GZSL models: LESA \cite{9157745} and MLZSL \cite{lee2018multilabelzeroshotlearningstructured} (Figure~\ref{fig:results}).
